üìå Mymory Bubbles
Concept: Bubble = Event

Each bubble represents a memory event: it could be a party, a meeting, a trip, or even a solitary moment of reflection.

Shape & Style: circular, organic, no rigid edges.

Visual: smooth gradients, fluid and alive, floating against a dark background.

Connections: subtle translucent lines or light trails connecting bubbles, representing relationships (people in common, shared themes, or timeline).

Fluidity: movements must be smooth and organic, never blocky or jerky.

Interactivity

Clicking (or touching) a bubble expands it with a glassmorphic effect (Glassmorphism).

Expansion reveals event details: photos, comments, people involved.

Bubbles without photos = blue blur gradient.

Bubbles with photos = photo inside the circle + blur preview.

When the user clicks the action button ‚Üí the bubble ‚Äúbursts‚Äù and shows the photo in full resolution, with description below (similar to an Instagram post).

Connections adjust dynamically, like elastic bands, when bubbles move or expand.

üìÇ File Structure

mymory.html
The visual engine that renders the bubble universe.

Scans the /bubbles/ folder.

Generates each bubble dynamically from metadata.

Draws fluid movements and connections.

/bubbles/ folder
Each subfolder = one bubble/event.

Folder name = date in format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.

}

Rendering Logic in mymory.html

A JS script scans /bubbles/.

For each config.json, it generates a bubble:

Size proportional to relevance or number of interactions.

Position fluid, with smooth organic movement.

Connections based on timeline (dates) or relationships.

Clicking a bubble ‚Üí opens a glassmorphic popup with event details (photo, text, links).

üé® Differentiator

Bubbles are not hardcoded ‚Äî they are generated automatically from files.

In the future, the data source can shift from /bubbles/ folder to a real database.

üëâ Short term: manual creation of bubble folders.
üëâ Long term: a scalable social network where users create their own bubbles.

This architecture makes Mymory a living web, capable of evolving from a prototype into a complete social platform.
